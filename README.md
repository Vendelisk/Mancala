# Mancala
<p>Quick JFX version of Mancala I made after a lackluster OOD project to play around with the API.</p>
<p>If somehow you've stumbled across this and are curious to try it you should be able to just grab the .exe file and run from there.</p>
<p>I've only built this for Windows so if you're on a different platform it's up to you to build for that.  It's not complicated but it's tedious and I don't wanna :P</p>
